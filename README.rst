Wagtail Robots
==============

This is a basic Django application for Wagtail to manage robots.txt files
following the `robots exclusion protocol`_, complementing the Django_
`Sitemap contrib app`_.

This started as a fork of `Django Robots`_ but because of the differences
between the Django Admin and the Wagtail Admin, and other project requirements
git history has not been retained.

For installation instructions and configuration instructions,
`check out the docs`_.
